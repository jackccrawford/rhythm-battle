# Sound Assets

This directory contains placeholder sound files for the Rhythm Battle game. In a production environment, you would replace these with high-quality sound effects and music.

## Required Sound Files

- `perfect.mp3`: Sound played when hitting a note with perfect timing
- `good.mp3`: Sound played when hitting a note with good timing
- `okay.mp3`: Sound played when hitting a note with okay timing
- `miss.mp3`: Sound played when missing a note
- `click.mp3`: UI click sound
- `start.mp3`: Sound played when starting the game
- `gameover.mp3`: Sound played when the game ends
- `bgm.mp3`: Background music for the game

## Placeholder Files

For demonstration purposes, we've included placeholder sound files. These are minimal audio files that demonstrate the functionality but should be replaced with proper sound assets for a complete game experience.
